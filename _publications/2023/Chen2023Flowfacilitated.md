#   The imposed laminar flow has been shown to facilitate ignition under certain conditions in our previous work (Chen et al. 2023). Such flow-facilitated ignition (FFI) was observed only for mixtures with sufficiently large effective Lewis numbers, i.e., Le>>1. It is not clear whether FFI can also occur in a mixture with Le<1 and Le∼1. This study will investigate the occurrence of FFI in a mixture with low Lewis number. We conduct multi-dimensional simulations of forced ignition by a pair of electrodes in both static and flowing hydrogen/air mixtures. A simplified ignition model is used in simulations. The laminar flow direction is perpendicular to the pair of electrodes. We consider different values for equivalence ratio (ϕ=0.4 and 1.0), pressure (P = 0.3–1 atm), electrode gap distance (dgap=0.64–3.88 mm) and flow velocity (Uin=0–10 m/s). The simulation results show that FFI can occur in a fuel-lean (ϕ=0.4) H2/air mixture with Le≈0.43 at sub-atmospheric pressure. This indicates that large Lewis number is not a necessary condition for FFI occurring in simulations considering a simplified ignition model. Here, the favorable conditions for FFI are large critical ignition radius at sub-atmospheric pressure, sufficiently small electrode gap distance and moderate flow velocity. Moreover, the reduction in heat loss to the electrodes by the imposed flow is found to be crucial for FFI. To further understand the boundary conditions of FFI, an ignition mode regime diagram in terms of flow velocity and normalized critical ignition radius (i.e. the ratio of critical ignition radius and electrode gap distance) is proposed. The present study provides insights on the effects of laminar flow on forced ignition of premixed flames.
