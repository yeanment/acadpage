#   Forced ignition has broad application in engines. Usually fuel-lean mixtures of large hydrocarbons are used in engines and they have large Lewis numbers, Le. Due to the high positive stretch of the expanding ignition kernel, it is very difficult to ignite a mixture with very large Le. In this study, the forced ignition of a fuel-rich H2/air mixture with Le ≈ 2.3 in a laminar counterflow is investigated via two-dimensional simulations. The emphasis is placed on assessing the flow effects on ignition in mixtures with large Le. The transient ignition kernel development and the minimum ignition energy (MIE) at different strain rates and different ignition positions are studied. The counterflow is found to greatly affect the ignition kernel development and MIE for Le ≈ 2.3. The counterflow compresses the ignition kernel and changes its shape from a sphere to an oblate spheroid. Consequently, the flame propagating in the axial direction is strengthened since its curvature is reduced and Le > 1; while the opposite occurs to the flame propagating in the radial direction. With the increase of strain rate, the radial flame has a negative displacement speed and extinguishes, and thereby the MIE increases. To achieve successful ignition at large Le and at high strain rate, a strong anchored axial flame needs to be formed. Counterintuitively, it is found that moving the ignition position away from the stagnation point can reduce the MIE and thereby promote ignition for the present mixture with large Le. Such ignition enhancement is caused by the reduction of the flame curvature of the flame propagating in the radial direction. The change of the density-weighted displacement speed with the Karlovitz number is also studied for the transient ignition process; and strong unsteadiness is observed. This work provides insights on better understanding of the ignition of mixtures with Le > 2 under strained conditions.
