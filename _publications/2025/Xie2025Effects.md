#     Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2, has become a crucial goal in addressing climate change. Ammonia emerges as a promising zero-carbon fuel in sustainable energy solutions. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of stratified ammonia/air flames using one-dimensional simulations, with emphasis on flame propagation, pollutant formation, and fuel slip characteristics. The results demonstrate that stratification can significantly modify flame propagation speeds by up to ±40 % compared to homogeneous mixtures. The effects of preferential diffusion and Soret diffusion are also examined. It is found that while preferential diffusion substantially influences flame speeds, its impact on the relative difference between homogeneous and stratified flames remains minimal. The Soret diffusion has negligible effects on the propagation speeds in both scenarios, though significant H2 is formed in the burnt zone on the rich side. Then, the effects of stratification on NOx formation are examined. Both lean-to-rich and rich-to-lean stratifications demonstrate potential for NO emission reduction under slightly rich conditions, respectively achieving reductions of up to 40 % and 25 % relative to corresponding homogeneous flames. Meanwhile, rich-to-lean stratification proves effective for N2O mitigation on the rich side. Fuel slip characteristics, primarily NH3 and H2, are found to be predominantly governed by local equivalence ratios rather than by stratification. At the end, the stratification layer thickness effects are examined. The results reveal that it significantly influences flame propagation, while showing limited impact on downstream pollutant formation and fuel slip behavior. These findings provide insights into the fundamental characteristics of stratified NH3 flames, thereby contributing to the development of zero-carbon combustion strategies.
