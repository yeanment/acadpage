#   In this study, one-dimensional detailed simulations of stretched premixed counterflow flames are conducted to investigate the flame extinction, bifurcations, and burning limits of NH3/air and NH3/H2/air mixtures at elevated pressures up to 25 atm. For the NH3/air mixtures, the incorporation of radiative heat loss results in a left weak flame branch at low strain rates, which exists only within a narrow strain rate range. A regime diagram is proposed to illustrate sustainable strain rate ranges of normal and weak flames at different equivalence ratios. Kinetic analyses show that the ammonia oxidation in the weak flames is governed by H2NO at the lean side and N2Hx at the rich side. Nonetheless, for the normal flames, the H2NO, NHi, and N2Hx pathways are significant under lean, near stoichiometric, and rich conditions, respectively. Furthermore, the influence of hydrogen additions on ammonia flames is investigated. The results show that hydrogen addition, e.g., 0.1 by volume, leads to the formation of a stable right weak flame branch, with the H2NO sub-chemistry being the dominant oxidization mechanism. Then, the flame bifurcation and extinction behaviors at different equivalence ratios are summarized in a regime diagram with five critical strain rates. It is shown that the low-temperature H2NO route extends the rich burning limit from 3.45 to 5.68 for the NH3/H2/air mixture at a hydrogen mole fraction of 0.1. In the end, the burning limits are determined as a function of hydrogen molar fraction and pressure, and the hydrogen addition significantly expands the burning limits both on the lean and rich side. These findings provide valuable insights into the flammability of ammonia/hydrogen flames and the underlying oxidation mechanisms subject to elevated pressure conditions.
