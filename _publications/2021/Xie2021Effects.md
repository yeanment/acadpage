#   Forced ignition is one of the most fundamental and important combustion problems. It is used in advanced engines and closely related to fire safety and accidental explosion. In this study, forced ignition of laminar counterflow diffusion flames with one-step chemistry is studied through two-dimensional simulations. The initial ignition kernel is simply modelled as a hot spot of unburned gas with a specified radius and uniform high temperature inside it. We focus on the subsequent ignition kernel development, during which an expanding axisymmetric triple flame appears under certain conditions. Non-monotonic change of the flame kernel radius with time is observed near the critical ignition conditions. The effects of strain rate and Lewis number on the ignition kernel development and critical ignition conditions are assessed. For the same initial hot spot, successful ignition can be achieved at relatively low strain rate and fuel Lewis number; while the ignition kernel quenches at relatively high strain rate or fuel Lewis number. The strain rate and Lewis number are shown to have great impact on the critical hot spot radius and on the minimum ignition energy. At relatively low strain rates, the minimum ignition energy increases linearly with the strain rate. This is consistent with previous theory on flame ball in a mixing layer. Besides, the optimum ignition position and the influence of the hot spot shape are investigated. It is demonstrated that the optimum ignition position is close to the stoichiometric surface and it depends on the Lewis number and global equivalence ratio.
