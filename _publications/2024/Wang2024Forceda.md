#   Recently, low-temperature chemistry (LTC) and LTC-induced cool flames have attracted extensive interest since they can substantially influence the ignition process and accelerate the subsequent hot flame propagation. However, it is unclear how the flow affects the forced ignition of a cool flame and its subsequent transition to a hot flame. In this study, we conduct transient 2D simulations for the forced ignition processes of premixed cool and hot flames in a laminar, axisymmetric, counterflow configuration with well-defined flow field. Different ignition energies and strain rates are used to ignite and stabilize cool and/or hot flames in a counterflow. The critical conditions for the ignition of cool and hot flames are identified, and the cool flame kernel quenching and its transition to hot flame are discussed. It is found that the ignition energy determines the highest temperature and thereby controls the thermal runaway process. The strain rate influences the flame kernel propagation and the transition from cool flame to hot flame. A large strain rate may quench the cool flame, while a small strain rate may lead to the transition from cool flame to hot flame due to the sufficiently long residence time. Therefore, cool flame ignition and stabilization can only be achieved within a certain range of strain rates. Furthermore, an ignition regime diagram in terms of ignition energy and strain rate is proposed, and four regimes are identified: (I) only cool flame, (II) only hot flame, (III) ignition failure, and (IV) transition from cool flame to hot flame (with appearance of double flame structure). These results provide new insights into how the flow affects the cool flame ignition and transition.
