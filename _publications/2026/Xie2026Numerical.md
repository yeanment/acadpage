#     The interactions between NH3 and nitrogen oxides (including N2O and NOx) offer unique insights into ammonia’s combustion chemistry via active nitrogen–nitrogen coupling mechanisms. An in-depth understanding of these interactions is essential for the development of kinetic models, emission control, and strategies for enhancing combustion via modified oxidizers. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of laminar premixed ammonia/air flames enriched with N2O or NOxvia one-dimensional simulations. The results demonstrate that all three nitrogen oxide species significantly enhance flame propagation, with NO showing the strongest enhancement at low concentrations, followed by NO2 and N2O. However, with increasing NO addition, the flame speed attains a maximum at and then gradually declines with further enrichment. Such non-monotonic trends are not seen with N2O or NO2 addition. A decoupling analysis is further employed to isolate oxy-enrichment, thermal, chemical, and transport effects. For all three cases, the thermal effect is the dominant contributor. Interestingly, NO exhibits dual chemical behavior: it promotes combustion at low concentrations but inhibits it at high levels. The key reactions are also identified with the rate of progress and sensitivity analyses. Meanwhile, the correlations between the simulated laminar flame speeds and the theoretical expressions are examined over different addition ratios. Besides, pollutant emissions are also examined, showing increased NO levels with N2O or NOx addition. The chemical effects have a more pronounced impact on NO emissions than on flame speed. At the end, the flammability limits are determined where the radiative heat losses are modeled via the optically thin model. The results indicated a significant widening of the flammable range, with N2O or NOx addition. These findings provide critical insights into nitrogen–nitrogen coupling mechanisms and offer pathways for enhanced ammonia combustion technologies in carbon-free energy systems.
