#   This study investigates wedge-induced oblique detonations in high-speed n-dodecane droplet/air mixtures under real flight conditions. A skeletal mechanism with 54 species and 269 reactions is employed to examine the flow structure and chemical kinetics of spray oblique detonation waves (ODWs), focusing on the impacts of flight altitude. Results show that spray ODWs exhibit significant non-uniformity and wave front instability compared to gaseous ODWs. The presence of droplets leads to irregularities in the distributions of heat release rate and temperature, inducing complex shock structures. Notably, localized shocklets near the evaporation completion front and wedge surface emerge from the interplay between droplet evaporation and gas-phase reactions. Additionally, the formation and evolution of hot spots in the induction zone further amplify the wave front instability and contribute to the overall non-uniformity of spray ODWs. Increasing flight altitude leads to reduced inflow pressure, which weakens the droplet breakup process and increases the penetration distance. As a result, the heat release rate behind the shock front decreases, and the separation between the shock and reaction fronts becomes more pronounced. The transition mode is significantly affected by flight altitude, evolving from abrupt to smooth as altitude increases. This research provides crucial insights into the characteristics of spray ODWs under various flight altitude conditions, offering valuable guidance for the development of oblique detonation engines using liquid fuels.
